    <p>Hello! My name is Bryan and I am a web developer! But am I just a developer? No! I have many other hobbies including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skateboarding</li>
      <li>Hanging out with my family</li>
      <li>Home renovation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also really enjoy lawn care but that doesn't seem to interest that many people.</p>
